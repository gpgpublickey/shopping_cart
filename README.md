# Getting Started with Shopping cart
![mapanimal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7245667/156694282-3b06fc8d-c137-47c8-8a56-d0459f434820.gif)
Pet adopting shopping cart, this site is part of the metaverse of Mapanimal, a platform to take care of animals in risk using technology in their favor.
The pet adopting system will be integrated to the Mapanimal web page to bring to many animal-care organizations the chance to publish their rescued animals.
On this way, people will have the chance to choose a pet to adopt and give it a home.

## Non functional requirements:

The site is built as an SPA app with React.

Tailwind (https://tailwindcss.com/) was chosen to handle styling over all the SPA.

In addition, Jest is the unit testing framework.

Most of the HTTP calls are mocked as static JSON file in the /public/mocks folder. This ones will be replaced by an Firebase API as part of the application roadmap.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deployment
The app is deployed using vercel.

The last version of the deployed site is here: https://shopping-cart-cristiangiagante.vercel.app/
